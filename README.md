# CLOJURE EXCHANGE 2015 - SkillsMatter, London


__Heard at Clojure eXchange:__
* _"Lisp is the best language"_ -> I think the context was: easy to write DSL (domain-specific languages)
* _"Cider rocks"_ -> well of course cause CIDER = Clojure Interactive Development Environment that Rocks!
* _"Emacs is the one true editor"_ -> choose your ~~religion~~ editor
* _"Prismatic schema ftw"_ -> heard in several talks
* _"Pure function is the solution"_ -> avoid state


__Videos recommended by speakers:__
* ["Thinking in Data"](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Thinking-in-Data) by Stuart Sierra at Clojure/West
* ["Simplicity matters"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0) by Rich Hickey at Rails Conf 2012 (keynote)
* ["Simple made easy"](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) by Rich Hickey at Strange Loop


## Day 1 - 03/12/2015

#### Chris Ford, Dueling keyboards [Keynote] - [Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7240-keynote-dueling-keyboards), [Slides](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7240-keynote-dueling-keyboards)

Libraries references: [Overtone](https://overtone.github.io/)

My take-away:

The Baganda music has been research to illustrate the difference between the structure of its music and the rest of the world and more particularly between African music and Western European music. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baganda_music)


#### J. Pablo Fern√°ndez, What is a Macro? [Talk] - [Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7245-what-is-a-macro), [Slides]()

Other resource: [Blogpost](https://carouselapps.com/2015/08/13/macros-the-lisp-advantage/)


My take-away: 

1) macros are to be used carefully

"It's not about how many macros you write,
but how many functions you didn't write by writing a macro."

2) Lisps and AST

For Lisps the abstract syntax tree (AST) is accessible from a programme which makes it easy to extend the languages using macros. [Read more](http://www.braveclojure.com/read-and-eval/)
```

#### Bozhidar Batsov, CIDER: The journey so far and the road ahead [Talk] - [Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7225-cider-the-journey-so-far-and-the-road-ahead), [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/bbatsov/cider-the-story-so-far-and-the-road-ahead)

Libraries references: [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)

My take-away:

Must try: [cider debugger](http://endlessparentheses.com/cider-debug-a-visual-interactive-debugger-for-clojure.html),
[clj-refactor](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el), [squiggly-clojure](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure) and other goodies from cider 0.10!


#### Kris Jenkins, ClojureScript: Architecting for Scale [Talk] - [Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7227-clojurescript-architecting-for-scale), [Slides](https://github.com/krisajenkins/ClojureScriptForScale/blob/master/ClojureScriptForScale.org)

Libraries references:

[Demo](https://github.com/krisajenkins/petrol/tree/master/examples) to handle two counters and Spotify events on the same UI
using [Petrol](https://github.com/krisajenkins/petrol) framework.

My take-away:

Must try Petrol framework!

Also this framework is inspired from the Elm architecture. See Kris' Elm architecture tutorial [here](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial).

Must try and understand Elm =)


#### Ernestas Lisauskas - Garden: CSS in Clojure and ClojureScript [Lightning Talk] - [Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7250-lightning-talks-day-1), [Slides]()

Libraries references: [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden)

My take-away: Like [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) but for CSS


#### David Humphreys - Testing times in Clojurescript [Lightning Talk] - [Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7250-lightning-talks-day-1), [Slides](https://github.com/davidjameshumphreys/testing-times-in-clojurescript)

Libraries references:

[Doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo): easy to configure,

[DevCards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards): provides an interactive visual REPL,

[Speclj](https://github.com/slagyr/speclj): TDD/BDD framework for Clojure


My take-away: I haven't worked with Cljs enough but those looks like good resources to try!


#### Dave Snowdon - Seeing With Clojure [Lightning Talk] - [Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7250-lightning-talks-day-1), [Slides](https://github.com/Davesnowdon/cljex-2015-opencv)

* [OpenCV in Python](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/)


My take-away: It's cool, but there are much more resources for OpenCV with Python
