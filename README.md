#### J. Pablo Fern√°ndez, What is a Macro? [Talk] - [Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7245-what-is-a-macro), [Slides]()

Libraries references: []()

My take-away: 

1) macros are to be used carefully

"It's not about how many macros you write,
but how many functions you didn't write by writing a macro."

2) Lisps and AST

For Lisps the abstract syntax tree (AST) is accessible from a programme which makes it easy to extend the languages using macros. [Read more](http://www.braveclojure.com/read-and-eval/)
